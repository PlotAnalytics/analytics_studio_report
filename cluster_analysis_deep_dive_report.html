    <h1>YouTube Analytics: Cluster Analysis Deep Dive</h1>
    <p>Generated on May 9, 2024</p>

    <div class="executive-summary">
        <h2>Executive Summary</h2>
        <p>This report provides an in-depth analysis of the four distinct video performance clusters identified in our YouTube analytics data. Each cluster represents a unique content archetype with specific performance characteristics and strategic implications.</p>
        <p>Our analysis reveals clear patterns in how different types of content perform across key metrics, offering actionable insights for content strategy optimization and resource allocation.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>Understanding Cluster Analysis in YouTube Analytics</h2>
    <p>Cluster analysis is a machine learning technique that identifies natural groupings within data. In this analysis, we used K-means clustering to group videos based on seven key performance metrics:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Engaged views</strong>: Number of views with active engagement (likes, comments, shares)</li>
        <li><strong>Likes to Engaged Views Ratio</strong>: Percentage of engaged viewers who liked the video</li>
        <li><strong>Comments to Engaged Views Ratio</strong>: Percentage of engaged viewers who commented on the video</li>
        <li><strong>Stayed to watch (%)</strong>: Percentage of viewers who did not immediately swipe away</li>
        <li><strong>Average percentage viewed (%)</strong>: Average percentage of the video that viewers watched</li>
        <li><strong>Virality Score</strong>: Weighted score combining key engagement metrics</li>
        <li><strong>Growth Potential</strong>: Combined metric of subscriber growth and engagement</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The algorithm identified four distinct clusters, each representing a different "content archetype" with unique performance characteristics.</p>

    <h2>Cluster Overview</h2>

    <h2>Cross-Cluster Analysis and Strategic Implications</h2>

    <h3>Content Portfolio Balance</h3>
    <p>Your current content portfolio appears to be distributed across the clusters as follows:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Solid Performers (Cluster 0):</strong> 70.9% of content</li>
        <li><strong>Viral Performers (Cluster 1):</strong> 6.0% of content</li>
        <li><strong>Niche Engagers (Cluster 2):</strong> 23.1% of content</li>
        <li><strong>Anomalous Content (Cluster 3):</strong> 0.02% of content (1 video)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This distribution reveals that while your viral content drives the majority of your engaged views, it represents a relatively small portion of your overall content production. Meanwhile, nearly half of your content falls into the Niche Engagers category, which has the lowest engaged viewership but highest growth potential.</p>

    <div class="insights-box">
        <h3>Key Strategic Insights</h3>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Balanced Content Strategy:</strong> Each cluster serves a different strategic purpose in your channel ecosystem:
                <ul>
                    <li>Viral Performers (Cluster 2) drive reach and brand awareness</li>
                    <li>Solid Performers (Cluster 0) maintain consistent engagement with existing audience</li>
                    <li>Niche Engagers (Cluster 1) build community and foster deeper audience connections</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Content Distribution:</strong> Your content is heavily weighted toward Solid Performers (70.9%), with a smaller portion of Niche Engagers (23.1%) and only a small percentage of Viral Performers (6.0%).</li>
            <li><strong>Engagement Patterns:</strong> Different clusters show distinct engagement patterns:
                <ul>
                    <li>Viral content (Cluster 2) drives high likes-to-engaged-views ratio (8.82%) but low comments</li>
                    <li>Niche content (Cluster 1) generates more discussion relative to its engaged viewership (0.21% comments-to-engaged-views ratio)</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Retention Metrics:</strong> Both Viral Performers (84.89%) and Solid Performers (82.78%) maintain excellent average viewing percentages, while Niche Engagers have significantly lower retention (61.31%).</li>

            <li><strong>Optimize Content Mix:</strong> Consider producing more Viral Performer content (currently only 6.0% of videos) while maintaining a healthy balance of Solid Performers and Niche Engagers.</li>
            <li><strong>Content Transformation:</strong> Analyze what elements could be transferred from your Viral Performers (Cluster 2) to your Niche Engagers (Cluster 1) to improve their retention metrics while maintaining their community-building strengths.</li>
            <li><strong>Audience Segmentation:</strong> Develop a more nuanced understanding of which audience segments engage with each content cluster and tailor your content strategy accordingly.</li>
            <li><strong>Testing Framework:</strong> Implement a systematic testing framework to experiment with content elements across clusters to identify what drives improved performance.</li>
            <li><strong>Metrics Alignment:</strong> Ensure your performance metrics and goals align with the strategic purpose of each content type - don't judge all content by the same engaged view metrics.</li>
        </ol>
    </div>

    <h2>Next Steps for Further Analysis</h2>
    <p>To deepen your understanding of these content archetypes and further optimize your strategy, consider these follow-up analyses:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Conduct a detailed content audit to identify specific topics, formats, and presentation styles associated with each cluster</li>
        <li>Analyze temporal patterns to determine if certain clusters perform better at different times of day, days of the week, or seasons</li>
        <li>Examine the relationship between video production quality/investment and cluster assignment</li>
        <li>Track individual videos' movement between clusters over time to identify patterns in how content performance evolves</li>
        <li>Analyze audience demographics and behaviors across clusters to better understand who engages with each content type</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Video Lists by Cluster</h2>
    <p>Below are sample videos from each cluster. These lists can help you identify common characteristics and patterns within each content archetype.</p>
